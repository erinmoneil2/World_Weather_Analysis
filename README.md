# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this assignment is to help build the basis for travelers to find travel locations based off of desired temperatures. As we are entering into the winter months, this is a great way to find locations for travelers who love warm places! In our first deliverable, we create a database of roughly 700 random cities throughout the world. In our Vacation Search deliverable, we are able to take that database and add a user promt that asks the traveler what type of weather (temperature) they are looking for. That criteria helps us to narrow down our search and only show locations on a map that have a temperature within the desired range. In our last deliverable, we are able to map out a route for our traveler (in this case I did driving) by driving, biking, or walking distances, as well as the nearest hotel to that location.
